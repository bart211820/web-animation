## About the artwork
That Way to the Left is a book written and designed by Miriam Brack. It's a book about the different designs and shapes of arrows. The arrow once served as a weapon, but now points us in the direction we want to go? 
The cover of the book has an artwork of a raster with 10 Rows and 7 columns. More about it can be found here:

## About this project
In this project, I edited the artwork on the book with html, css and javascript. I turned the raster into some kind of game / puzzle where different shapes of arrows appear and point you to one of the squares. Once you've found the right square you've completed the level and a different one will show up. Playing through this you will see a variety of different arrows, just like browsing through the book would do.

## Konami Code (spoiler alert)
For one of the levels you will have to enter the konami code. A well known cheat code sequence consisting of arrows and 2 characters. I thought this was quite fitting for a game all about arrows.
